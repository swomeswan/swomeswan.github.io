## Word Master

https://octokatherine.github.io/word-master/

Heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>, Word Master is a word guessing game similar to Mastermind. I created this because I love Wordle, but the once a day limit leaves me wanting more.

### Rules

You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word. Each guess can be any valid word.

After submitting a guess, the letters will turn gray, green, or yellow.
- Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
- Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
- Gray: The letter is incorrect.
